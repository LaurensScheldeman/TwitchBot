shredbot99: The Shred Nation has shredded 4564 pieces of paper... Make sure the shredder doesn't overheat.
[18:24] 
shredbot99: Great job shredding thewesdude! You just received a bonus of 422 Shreckles.
[18:25] 
dy5l3x14: a gate sends multiple signals if a train isn't going fast enough Wes
[18:25] 
coolhandcody: !message @TheWesDude
[18:25] 
lovely_santa: wes, message is 20K shreckles
[18:25] 
shredbot99: Sorry coolhandcody. You need more Shreckles to run that command!
[18:25] 
daigakisei: !message TesWesDude
[18:25] 
shredbot99: daigakisei has a message for you sir.
[18:25] 
lovely_santa: i was gonna do that diagakisei
[18:25] 
thewesdude: Santa that needs to be fixed then!
[18:25] 
coolhandcody: damn that's an expensive message
[18:25] 
jms_02: !skrilla
[18:25] 
shredbot99: jms_02 You're rolling large with 28,121 Shreckles!
[18:25] 
intertoothh: a:D
[18:25] 
intertoothh: :D
[18:25] 
marc_intosh: and a gate also sends a signal if a player runs through (or nearby fast enough)
[18:26] 
daigakisei: @lovely_santa you can still do it, i like that frase.
[18:26] 
lovely_santa: once is enough ;)
[18:26] 
dy5l3x14: gates are just terrible for sending signals :P
[18:26] 
dy5l3x14: not reliable enough
[18:26] 
thewesdude: have the gate open on a signal then
[18:26] 
marc_intosh: and if the gate is closed? the train will smash through then
[18:27] 
voske_123: wohoo got the multiplayer for Kerbal Space Program working
[18:27] 
voske_123: :p
[18:27] 
marc_intosh: I wish gates would send different signals for trains and players
[18:27] 
dy5l3x14: it does look like a tick timing issue yeah :P
[18:27] 
lovely_santa: otherwise i rephrase?
[18:28] 
marc_intosh: nice voske
[18:28] 
lovely_santa: send the green signal to the station, so the train will leave, when train has left and green = 1 (this green=1 need to have a tick or 2 ticks delay), then send the signal to your memory cell on top
[18:28] 
coolhandcody: @Voske_123 good luck with that, my CPU just flips ma bird and laughs when i try to launch a rocket
[18:29] 
coolhandcody: flips me a*
[18:29] 
jms_02: @CoolHandCody i know the feeling

[18:29] -- Done updating userdata.
[18:29] 
marc_intosh: what cpu do you have? a single core? :D
[18:30] 
lovely_santa: marc, if you have 1 core, with 8 logic cores, you'll be fine
[18:31] 
lovely_santa: most likely that won't exist ;)
[18:31] 
intertoothh: how do you mp in ksp?
[18:31] 
lovely_santa: i'll design one
[18:31]

[18:31] 
eastborn: @CoolHandCody no K? :D
[18:31] 
eastborn: as in unlocked for overclocking :D
[18:32]

[18:32] 
intertoothh: might be PEBCAK
[18:32] 
intertoothh: otherwise
[18:32] 
marc_intosh: layer 8 problem
[18:32] 
voske_123: @intertoothh DMP mod and with Syncrio u can synch the science and progress together
[18:32] 
eastborn: OUCH
[18:32] 
voske_123: so u build a space agency togethere
[18:32] 
eastborn: RIP SYSTEM
[18:33] 
voske_123: if u want we can test it out @intertoothh
[18:33] 
intertoothh: i dont have KSP
[18:33] 
voske_123: ah ok :'(
[18:33]

[18:34] 
the1wolf34: what is shred trying to do?
[18:34] 
marc_intosh: why pain?
[18:34] 
voske_123: nah i think shredguy needs to play a bit of ksp to relax
[18:34] 
voske_123: maybe in the multiplayer version it would be easier
[18:34] 
coolhandcody: @Marc_Intosh brain bending mind melting neurologic pain
[18:34] 
voske_123: !message
[18:34] 
shredbot99: voske_123 has a message for you sir.
[18:34] 
jms_02: this is why i want a ingame computer console for programming, combinators hurt my brain
[18:34] 
eastborn: @shred why not cycle over stations on ticks and and process each station and determine to send train like that?
[18:34] 
eastborn: !punch
[18:34] -- Updating userdata, this can take a second.
[18:34] 
shredbot99: Wake up!
[18:34] -- Done updating userdata.
[18:34] 
lovely_santa: decrease the signal by 1 each station that has a train for that type of train, like we said
[18:35] 
shredbot99: Find out how many Shreckles you've accumulated by typing in !skrilla or !shreckles
[18:35] 
eastborn: yes, thats how timers work :D
[18:35] 
eastborn: its pretty easy
[18:35] 
marc_intosh: :D

[18:37] 
thewesdude: if your problem is that when you receive 1 signal from the mine, and you release a train it does 2 negatives, then just double it so it adds 2 signals not just 1?
[18:37] 
lovely_santa: dammit marc
[18:38] 
eastborn: did it crash @lovely_santa ? XD
[18:38] 
lovely_santa: no it didn't
