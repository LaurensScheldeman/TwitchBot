[18:47] -- Done updating userdata.
[18:47]

[18:52] 
marc_intosh: make a combinator array where you input the train ID and it outputs iron ore or copper ore
[18:53] 
intertoothh: ^^^
[18:53] 
marc_intosh: you'd need a combinator for each train
[18:53] 
intertoothh: KIS
[18:53] 
lovely_santa: i give up, intertoothh, you can explain :p
[18:53]

[18:54] 
shredbot99: Looks like the cops have given up the search ... the banks are ripe for hitting!
[18:54] 
marc_intosh: if you want to send two trains (or more) don't send them at the same time. send the first train first and then the second one.

marc_intosh: TheWesDude you close every station except the one you want the train to go to
[18:56] 
thewesdude: Marc but what if 1 mine opens when the train is en-route to one already
[18:56] 
thewesdude: then you will end up with 2 trains to same mine
[18:56] 
marc_intosh: you gotta control the junctions
[18:57] santaBot99: Alright guys, check your guns. We are storming into the ShredNation National Reserve through all entrances. Let's get the cash and get out before the cops get here.
[18:57] 
azazelreborn: WHY -172?
[18:57] 
intertoothh: neah
[18:57] 
intertoothh: yes shred you need that :D
[18:57] 
marc_intosh: no
[18:57] santaBot99: The crew suffered major losses as they engaged the SWAT backup. The remaining crew barely made it scoring 30,000 Shreckles from the vault.
[18:57] 
marc_intosh: why for each station?
[18:57] 
intertoothh: or 1 array, and just 'ask' what it is with a pulse
[18:57] santaBot99: The heist payouts are: thewesdude: 25,000 (5,000) - jerithgeros: 5,000 (1,000)

intertoothh: then rember that untill it gets a new T
[18:57] 
thewesdude: no matter what, if your mines are named the same, you will end up with 2 trains going to the same mine eventually
[18:58] 
coolhandcody: you just need a logic chain if _ then _ else if _ then _
